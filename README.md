# Fantasy Baseball Tools

This project is primarily a personal project to help me with managing my fantasy baseball teams. Currently, the scope is pretty small and only includes a draft board that can be used to see at a glance what major sites rank individual players and the difference vs how ESPN ranks them. More features are on the way, but until then I'll keep this short and sweet. To get it running, clone the project, install the proper Ruby version (currently 3.3.4), bundle, and run with `./bin/dev` in order for the app to pickup any Tailwind changes you make, and hit it at `localhost:3000` in your browser. More info and a better README to come!
